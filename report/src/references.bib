  abstract = {We present an algorithm, APD, that solves the distance version of the all-pairs-shortest-path problem for undirected, unweighted n-vertex graphs in time O(M(n) log n), where M(n) denotes the time necessary to multiply two n × n matrices of small integers (which is currently known to be o(n2.376)). We also address the problem of actually finding a shortest path between each pair of vertices and present a randomized algorithm that matches APD in its simplicity and in its expected running time.},

  abstract  = {For large state-space Markovian Decision Problems Monte-Carlo planning is one of the few viable approaches to find near-optimal solutions. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, UCT, that applies bandit ideas to guide Monte-Carlo planning. In finite-horizon or discounted MDPs the algorithm is shown to be consistent and finite sample bounds are derived on the estimation error due to sampling. Experimental results show that in several domains, UCT is significantly more efficient than its alternatives.},

  abstract  = {Assuming that numerical scores are available for the performance of each of n persons on each of n jobs, the “assignment problem” is the quest for an assignment of persons to jobs so that the sum of the n scores so obtained is as large as possible. It is shown that ideas latent in the work of two Hungarian mathematicians may be exploited to yield a new method of solving this problem.},

  abstract = {Although the problem of determining the minimum cost path through a graph arises naturally in a number of interesting applications, there has been no underlying theory to guide the development of efficient search procedures. Moreover, there is no adequate conceptual framework within which the various ad hoc search strategies proposed to date can be compared. This paper describes how heuristic information from the problem domain can be incorporated into a formal mathematical theory of graph searching and demonstrates an optimality property of a class of search strategies.},
